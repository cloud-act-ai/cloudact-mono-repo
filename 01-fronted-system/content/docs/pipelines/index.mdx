title: Pipelines Overview
description: Understanding CloudAct data pipelines and automation
---

Pipelines are automated processes that fetch, process, and normalize your cost data from various providers into a unified format for analysis.

## What Are Pipelines?

Pipelines are the engine that powers CloudAct's cost analytics. They:

- **Fetch** raw data from provider APIs and exports
- **Transform** data into standardized formats
- **Enrich** with hierarchy and metadata
- **Store** in BigQuery for analysis
- **Calculate** costs using current pricing

## How Pipelines Work

### Data Flow

```
Provider API/Export
       ↓
  ┌─────────────┐
  │   FETCH     │  Authenticate & retrieve raw data
  └─────────────┘
       ↓
  ┌─────────────┐
  │  TRANSFORM  │  Normalize to standard schema
  └─────────────┘
       ↓
  ┌─────────────┐
  │   ENRICH    │  Add hierarchy, apply pricing
  └─────────────┘
       ↓
  ┌─────────────┐
  │   STORE     │  Write to BigQuery tables
  └─────────────┘
       ↓
  ┌─────────────┐
  │  CONVERT    │  Generate FOCUS 1.3 format
  └─────────────┘
```

### Pipeline Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Idempotent** | Re-running replaces data (no duplicates) |
| **Incremental** | Processes one day at a time |
| **Retry-enabled** | Auto-retries on transient failures |
| **Auditable** | Complete run history with logs |

---

## Pipeline Status

Each pipeline run has a status:

| Status | Icon | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Queued** | 🕐 | Scheduled, waiting to execute |
| **Running** | 🔄 | Currently processing data |
| **Success** | ✓ | Completed successfully |
| **Failed** | ✗ | Encountered an error |
| **Partial** | ⚠ | Some records processed, some errors |

---

## Scheduling

### Automatic Schedule

Pipelines run automatically based on type:

| Pipeline Type | Schedule | Timezone |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Subscription** | Daily at 12:00 AM | Organization |
| **Cloud** | Daily at 6:00 AM | Organization |
| **GenAI** | Daily at 6:00 AM | Organization |

### Processing Windows

| Type | Data Processed | Typical Delay |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Subscription** | Previous day | None (calculated) |
| **Cloud** | 2 days ago | 24-48 hours |
| **GenAI** | Previous day | 24 hours |

<Callout type="info">
  Cloud providers have billing data delays. Pipelines account for this by processing data from 2 days prior.
</Callout>

### Manual Runs

Trigger pipelines on-demand:

1. Navigate to **Pipelines** → select type
2. Click **Run Now**
3. Select date range to process
4. Confirm to start

**Use cases for manual runs:**
- Backfill historical data
- Re-process after fixing credentials
- Immediate refresh after integration setup

---

## Run History

### Viewing History

Each pipeline section shows recent runs:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Run ID** | Unique identifier for the run |
| **Pipeline** | Type of pipeline executed |
| **Date Range** | Dates that were processed |
| **Status** | Success/Failed/Partial |
| **Records** | Number of records processed |
| **Duration** | How long execution took |
| **Started** | When the run began |
| **Completed** | When the run finished |

### Run Details

Click a run to view:

- **Execution logs** - Step-by-step processing output
- **Error messages** - Specific failure reasons
- **Records breakdown** - What was processed
- **Duration analysis** - Time spent in each phase

---

## Data Output

### BigQuery Tables

Pipelines write to specific tables per type:

**Subscription Pipelines:**

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `subscription_plans` | Source subscription configuration |
| `subscription_plan_costs_daily` | Calculated daily costs |
| `cost_data_standard_1_3` | FOCUS-formatted output |

**Cloud Pipelines:**

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `{provider}_billing_raw` | Raw billing data |
| `billing_cost` | Normalized cloud costs |
| `cost_data_standard_1_3` | FOCUS-formatted output |

**GenAI Pipelines:**

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `{provider}_usage_raw` | Raw usage data |
| `genai_costs_daily` | Calculated daily costs |
| `cost_data_standard_1_3` | FOCUS-formatted output |

### FOCUS 1.3 Standard

All pipelines convert data to FOCUS 1.3 for unified analytics:

| FOCUS Field | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `BilledCost` | Actual billed amount |
| `EffectiveCost` | Cost after discounts |
| `ListCost` | List/retail pricing |
| `ProviderName` | Cloud/SaaS provider |
| `ServiceName` | Specific service |
| `ServiceCategory` | Compute, Storage, AI, etc. |
| `ResourceId` | Unique resource identifier |
| `Region` | Geographic region |
| `UsageDate` | Date of usage |

**CloudAct Extensions:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `x_hierarchy_dept_id` | Department ID |
| `x_hierarchy_dept_name` | Department name |
| `x_hierarchy_project_id` | Project ID |
| `x_hierarchy_project_name` | Project name |
| `x_hierarchy_team_id` | Team ID |
| `x_hierarchy_team_name` | Team name |

## Pipeline Dependencies

### Execution Order

Some pipelines depend on others:

```
1. Subscription Plans (stored procedures)
   ↓
2. Subscription Cost Calculation
   ↓
3. FOCUS Conversion

1. Cloud Data Fetch (per provider)
   ↓
2. Billing Normalization
   ↓
3. FOCUS Conversion

1. GenAI Usage Fetch (per provider)
   ↓
2. Cost Calculation (with pricing)
   ↓
3. FOCUS Conversion
```

### Dependency Handling

- Pipelines wait for dependencies to complete
- Failures in upstream pipelines block downstream
- Status propagates through dependency chain

---

## Error Handling

### Automatic Retries

Transient failures are automatically retried:

| Failure Type | Retry Count | Backoff |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Network timeout** | 3 | Exponential |
| **Rate limit** | 5 | Provider-specific |
| **Auth token expired** | 1 | Refresh + retry |

### Manual Recovery

For persistent failures:

1. Check **Run Details** for error message
2. Fix the underlying issue:
   - Re-authenticate integration
   - Update credentials
   - Verify provider access
3. Trigger a **Manual Run**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Authentication failed** | Expired credentials | Re-authenticate in Integrations |
| **Rate limited** | Too many API calls | Wait and auto-retry |
| **No data returned** | Wrong date range | Check provider data availability |
| **Partial failure** | Some records failed | Check logs for specific errors |
| **Timeout** | Large data volume | Pipeline auto-continues |

### Checking Pipeline Health

1. Go to **Pipelines** in the sidebar
2. Review recent runs for each type
3. Look for:
   - Failed runs (red status)
   - Partial completions (yellow status)
   - Long durations (potential issues)

### Viewing Logs

1. Click on a specific run
2. Expand **Execution Logs**
3. Search for:
   - `ERROR` - Critical failures
   - `WARNING` - Non-fatal issues
   - `INFO` - Normal processing

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Monitor Regularly

- Check pipeline status daily
- Set up notifications for failures
- Review run history weekly

### 2. Keep Credentials Current

- Rotate API keys before expiration
- Update credentials promptly
- Test connections after updates

### 3. Understand Data Delays

- Cloud data: 24-48 hours delayed
- GenAI data: 24 hours delayed
- Subscription data: Calculated, no delay

### 4. Use Manual Runs Appropriately

- Backfill missing data
- Re-process after fixes
- Don't spam manual runs (rate limits)

### 5. Review Errors Promptly

- Address failures within 24 hours
- Prevent data gaps
- Document recurring issues

## Pipeline Notifications

### Setting Up Alerts

Get notified of pipeline events:

1. Go to **Notifications**
2. Enable **Pipeline Alerts**
3. Configure:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Trigger** | On failure, On success, On completion |
| **Pipelines** | All, or specific types |
| **Method** | Email, Slack, Webhook |
| **Recipients** | Users or channels |

### Alert Types

| Alert | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Failure** | Pipeline failed completely |
| **Partial** | Some records failed |
| **Recovery** | Previously failed now succeeded |
| **Long-running** | Execution exceeds threshold |
