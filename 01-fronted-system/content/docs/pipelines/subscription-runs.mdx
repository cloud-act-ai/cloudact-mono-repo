description: Pipelines for SaaS subscription cost processing
---

Subscription pipelines calculate and process costs from your SaaS subscription plans.

## How It Works

1. **Read subscription plans** - Fetch from your configured subscriptions
2. **Calculate daily costs** - Prorate monthly/annual costs to daily
3. **Apply hierarchy** - Assign costs to departments/projects/teams
4. **Write to BigQuery** - Store in standardized FOCUS format

## Pipeline Schedule

Subscription cost pipelines run:
- **Daily** at midnight (organization timezone)
- Process previous day's costs

## Triggering Manual Runs

1. Go to **Pipelines** → **Subscription Runs**
2. Click **Run Pipeline**
3. Select the date to process
4. Click **Confirm**

## Subscription Pipeline Types

### Cost Calculation

Calculates daily costs from subscription plans:

| Plan Type | Calculation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Monthly** | Monthly cost ÷ days in month |
| **Annual** | Annual cost ÷ 365 |
| **Per-seat** | Per-seat cost × active seats |

### FOCUS Conversion

Converts subscription costs to FOCUS 1.3 standard:
- Standardized cost categories
- Unified resource naming
- Hierarchy extension fields

## Run History

View recent subscription pipeline runs:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Run ID** | Unique identifier |
| **Date** | Date processed |
| **Status** | Success/Failed |
| **Records** | Subscription plans processed |
| **Duration** | Execution time |

## Cost Data Output

Subscription pipelines write to:

| Table | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `subscription_plan_costs_daily` | Daily cost calculations |
| `cost_data_standard_1_3` | FOCUS-formatted costs |

## Troubleshooting

### No Costs Showing

- Verify subscriptions are configured in **Integrations** → **Subscriptions**
- Check subscription start/end dates
- Ensure billing cycle is set correctly

### Incorrect Amounts

- Verify plan pricing is entered correctly
- Check currency settings match your organization
