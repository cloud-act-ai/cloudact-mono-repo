```

|---------|---------|
| **Informational** | Email digest |
| **Warning** | Email immediate |
| **Critical** | Email + Slack |
| **Urgent** | All channels |

### 4. Regular Review

- Review alerts monthly
- Adjust thresholds quarterly
- Remove obsolete alerts

### 5. Document Actions

- Note actions taken
- Track resolution time
- Improve based on patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Notifications

1. **Check spam folder** - Emails may be filtered
2. **Verify email** - Correct address in settings
3. **Check channel** - Slack/webhook configured correctly
4. **Check alert status** - Alert is enabled
5. **Check threshold** - Threshold hasn't been reached

### Too Many Notifications

1. **Increase thresholds** - Raise alert amounts
2. **Use digests** - Switch to daily/weekly
3. **Enable aggregation** - Batch similar alerts
4. **Reduce sensitivity** - Lower anomaly detection

### Slack Not Working

1. **Re-authorize** - Reconnect integration
2. **Check channel** - Bot has access to channel
3. **Check permissions** - Bot can post messages

<Callout type="tip">
  Start with weekly budget alerts at 80% and add more specific alerts as you understand your spending patterns.
