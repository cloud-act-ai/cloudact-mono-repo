## Cost Calculation

### How Costs Are Prorated

CloudAct calculates daily costs based on billing cycle:

| Billing Cycle | Daily Cost Formula |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Monthly** | Cost ÷ Days in month |
| **Quarterly** | Cost ÷ 90 days |
| **Annual** | Cost ÷ 365 days |
| **Custom** | Cost ÷ Days in period |

### Example Calculations

**Monthly Subscription:**
- Plan cost: $500/month
- January daily cost: $500 ÷ 31 = $16.13/day
- February daily cost: $500 ÷ 28 = $17.86/day

**Annual Subscription:**
- Plan cost: $5,000/year
- Daily cost: $5,000 ÷ 365 = $13.70/day

### Per-Seat Pricing

For subscriptions with per-user pricing:

```
Total Monthly Cost = Per-Seat Cost × Number of Seats
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Per-seat cost | $8.75 |
| Seats | 50 |
| **Monthly total** | **$437.50** |

When seats change, costs are prorated from the change date.

Use subscription data to optimize costs:

1. **Unused licenses** - Seats paid but not used
2. **Duplicate tools** - Multiple tools for same purpose
3. **Upgrade opportunities** - Annual vs monthly savings

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I track usage-based subscriptions?**
A: For usage-based services (AWS, GCP, etc.), use the Cloud Provider integrations instead. Subscriptions are for fixed-cost SaaS tools.

**Q: How do I handle multi-year contracts?**
A: Enter the annual cost and billing cycle as "Annual". CloudAct prorates to daily costs automatically.

**Q: Can I import from my accounting system?**
A: Use CSV import with data exported from your accounting software. Map fields to CloudAct format.

**Q: What happens to costs when I change plans?**
A: Plan changes create a version history. Historical reports use the pricing active at that time.
