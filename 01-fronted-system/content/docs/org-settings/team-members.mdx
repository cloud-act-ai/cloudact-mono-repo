## Seat Management

### Understanding Seats

- Each member occupies one seat
- Pending invites count as occupied seats
- Removing members frees seats

### Seat Usage

| Status | Counts as Seat |
|--------|----------------|
| Active member | Yes |
| Pending invite | Yes |
| Revoked invite | No |
| Removed member | No |

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate roles** - Give minimum necessary access
2. **Regular audits** - Review members quarterly
3. **Remove promptly** - Remove departing employees immediately
4. **Multiple admins** - Have at least 2 admins for redundancy

## Troubleshooting

### Invite Not Received

- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify email address spelling
- Resend invitation
- Ask recipient to add cloudact.ai to contacts

### Cannot Remove Member

- Cannot remove yourself
- Cannot remove the owner (transfer ownership first)
- Check your role permissions
