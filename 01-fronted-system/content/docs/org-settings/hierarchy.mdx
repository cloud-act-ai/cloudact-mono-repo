The Hierarchy feature lets you organize your company structure for accurate cost allocation and reporting.

## Understanding Hierarchy

CloudAct uses a three-level hierarchy:

```
Organization
└── Department
    └── Project
        └── Team
```

### Hierarchy Levels

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Department** | Top-level business unit | Engineering, Marketing, Sales |
| **Project** | Initiative within a department | Platform, Mobile App, Website |
| **Team** | Group working on a project | Backend, Frontend, DevOps |

## Accessing Hierarchy

Navigate to **Org Settings** → **Hierarchy** in the sidebar.

## Cost Allocation

### Assigning Costs

When creating subscriptions or integrations, assign them to hierarchy:

2. **Project** - Allocate to specific project
3. **Team** - Allocate to individual team

### Viewing Costs by Hierarchy

In **Cost Analytics**, filter by:
- Department
- Project
- Team

This enables:
- Chargeback reporting
- Budget tracking by unit
- Cost center analysis

## Import/Export

```csv

## Best Practices

1. **Mirror your org chart** - Hierarchy should reflect actual business structure

3. **Keep it simple** - Don't over-complicate with too many levels
4. **Review quarterly** - Update hierarchy as organization changes
