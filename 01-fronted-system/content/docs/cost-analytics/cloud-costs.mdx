| **Extensible** | Custom fields for hierarchy |

### FOCUS Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `BilledCost` | Actual billed amount | $125.50 |
| `EffectiveCost` | Cost after discounts | $100.00 |
| `ListCost` | List/retail pricing | $150.00 |
| `AmortizedCost` | RI/SP spread over term | $95.00 |
| `ProviderName` | Cloud provider | AWS |
| `ServiceName` | Specific service | Amazon EC2 |

## Reserved Capacity & Savings

### Reserved Instance Coverage

Track your RI/Savings Plan utilization:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Coverage** | % of eligible usage covered |
| **Utilization** | % of reserved capacity used |
| **Realized Savings** | Actual savings from reservations |
| **Potential Savings** | Additional savings available |
| **Expiring Soon** | Reservations expiring in 30/60/90 days |

### Savings Analysis

| Analysis | Shows |
|----------|-------|
| **On-Demand vs Reserved** | Cost difference if fully on-demand |
| **Spot Savings** | Savings from spot/preemptible |
| **Committed Use** | Savings from CUDs |
| **Credits Applied** | Promotional credits used |

### Recommendations

CloudAct identifies optimization opportunities:

| Recommendation | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Purchase RIs** | Steady-state workloads suitable for reservation |
| **Modify RIs** | RI modifications for better coverage |
| **Increase Spot** | Workloads suitable for spot instances |
| **Rightsizing** | Oversized instances to downsize |
| **Idle Resources** | Resources with zero utilization |

---

## Cost Optimization

### Optimization Categories

| Category | Savings Potential |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Rightsizing** | 10-30% of compute |
| **Reserved Capacity** | 20-40% of eligible usage |
| **Spot/Preemptible** | 60-90% for tolerant workloads |
| **Storage Tiering** | 30-50% of storage |
| **Idle Termination** | 100% of idle resources |
| **Region Optimization** | 5-20% for region changes |

### Identifying Waste

CloudAct highlights:

- **Idle instances** - Running but no CPU/network activity
- **Unattached storage** - Volumes not attached to instances
- **Old snapshots** - Snapshots older than retention policy
- **Overprovisioned** - Resources larger than needed
- **Unused load balancers** - LBs with no traffic
- **Zombie resources** - Orphaned resources

### Savings Tracking

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Identified Savings** | Total potential savings found |
| **Realized Savings** | Actually achieved savings |
| **In Progress** | Optimization work underway |
| **Savings Rate** | % of identified that's realized |

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Appearing

1. **Check integration** - Verify connection in Integrations
2. **Check billing export** - Ensure export is enabled in provider
3. **Wait for delay** - Cloud data has 24-48 hour delay
4. **Check date range** - Select dates with known spending

### Incorrect Amounts

1. **Compare with provider** - Check provider's billing console
2. **Check currency** - Verify conversion rates
3. **Check filters** - Ensure no filters hiding data
4. **Check credits** - Credits reduce billed amounts

### Missing Services

1. **Check permissions** - Ensure billing access for all services
2. **Check regions** - Some services are regional
3. **Check accounts** - Verify linked account access (AWS Organizations)

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Tag Everything

Apply consistent tags for cost allocation:

```
Environment: production
Team: platform
Project: api-gateway
CostCenter: CC-1001
Owner: platform-team@company.com
```

### 2. Regular Reviews

- **Daily**: Check for anomalies
- **Weekly**: Review top 10 services
- **Monthly**: Deep dive optimization
- **Quarterly**: RI/Savings Plan review

### 3. Set Budgets

- Define budgets per account/project
- Set alerts at 80% and 100%
- Review variances monthly

### 4. Optimize Continuously

- Address rightsizing recommendations
- Purchase RIs for steady workloads
- Use spot for batch/test workloads
- Clean up idle resources weekly

### 5. Share Ownership

- Share cost data with teams
- Include costs in project planning
- Review costs in sprint retrospectives
