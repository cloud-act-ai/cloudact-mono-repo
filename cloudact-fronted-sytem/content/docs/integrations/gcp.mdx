## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid service account"

- Make sure you uploaded the complete JSON file
- Check the service account exists in GCP
- Verify the JSON isn't corrupted

### "Permission denied"

The service account needs access to your billing account:

1. Go to [GCP Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)
2. Select your billing account
3. Click **Account Management**
4. Add your service account with **Billing Account Viewer** role

### "No data showing"

- GCP billing data can take up to 24 hours
- Ensure you have billing export enabled
- Check back the next day

## Disconnect

To remove the integration:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Google Cloud**
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Optionally, delete the service account in GCP
