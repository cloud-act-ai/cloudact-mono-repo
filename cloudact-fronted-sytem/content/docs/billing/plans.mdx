You can change your plan at any time. Changes take effect immediately.

## How to Change Plans

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Change Plan**
3. Select your new plan
4. Click **Confirm**

## Upgrading

When you upgrade:

- **Immediate access** to new features and higher limits
- **Prorated billing** - you only pay for the remaining days at the new rate
- **No downtime** - your account continues working seamlessly

### Example

Upgrading from Starter ($29/mo) to Professional ($99/mo) halfway through your billing cycle:

- You get credit for unused Starter days
- You're charged the prorated Professional rate
- Net charge is approximately $35

## Downgrading

When you downgrade:

- **Features remain** until your current billing period ends
- **Credit applied** to future invoices
- **Limits enforced** at the next billing cycle

| Limit | When It Applies |
|-------|-----------------|

| Providers | Immediately |
| Data Syncs | Immediately |

To cancel your subscription:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Manage Subscription**
