1. Hero Section (Top)
   Current: Mint green "Start Free Trial" button is prominent, with colorful text badges
   Improvements:

Reduce visual complexity of the gradient text effect (GenAI, Cloud, SaaS in different colors)
Add more contrast between the hero heading and subtitle for better readability
Include a compelling value prop image or dashboard preview to break up text-heavy design
Consider adding trust indicators (SOC2, certifications) earlier in the hero instead of below buttons

2. Announcement Banner
   Current: Pink/coral "NEW" badge with feature announcement
   Improvements:

The color works but ensure it doesn't clash when announcement is closed
Make dismissal more intuitive with clearer visual feedback
Consider animating this only on first load to avoid distraction on refresh

3. Stats Section (500+ Engineering Teams, $100M+ Cloud Spend)
   Current: Simple numbers with labels
   Improvements:

Add visual elements (icons or subtle graphics) to make it less text-only
Use a light background color or subtle grid pattern to separate this section visually
Include brief descriptive badges (FinOps Certified, Multi-Cloud Ready) more prominently here
Increase spacing/padding for breathing room

4. Integrations Section
   Current: Three columns showing Cloud Providers, GenAI Platforms, SaaS & DevTools
   Improvements:

The layout works well but add category icons above each heading
Include a small animation or hover effect when viewing icons to show tool names
Replace the generic "View all 50+ integrations" link with a more action-oriented button
Consider adding a subtle background pattern to make the section stand out

5. Teams/Collaboration Section (FinOps, Engineering, Finance, MSPs)
   Current: Four equal-sized cards with consistent styling
   Improvements:

Add subtle visual icons or small illustrations for each team type
Use different background tints (very light, non-brand colors) to differentiate cards
Make the "Learn more" links more visually distinct—perhaps with arrow indicators
Add a connecting visual element showing how these teams work together

6. Recognition Section
   Current: G2 rating displayed minimally with a "Leader" badge
   Improvements:

Make the G2 badge more visually prominent
Add additional third-party logos/ratings (if available) to build credibility
Consider showing a small quote or stat from the reviews
Add subtle animation on scroll to draw attention

7. "One Platform for All Your Cost Intelligence" Section
   Current: Three feature cards (GenAI, Multi-Cloud, SaaS) with bullet points
   Improvements:

Add subtle background color or card styling to differentiate from white space
Include small icon illustrations for each category
The "Learn more" links in mint need to be changed—use dark text with arrow instead
Add visual separator lines or hierarchy between the features
Consider alternating layout: feature + description on left, icon/visual on right

8. "Everything You Need to Control Costs" Section (Features)
   Current: Six icons with headings and descriptions in a grid
   Improvements:

Icons are good but some descriptions are quite brief—expand or add sub-features
Add subtle background cards with very light gray or accent colors
Increase the visual weight of feature icons
Group related features together rather than random order
Consider showing feature importance with visual depth/hierarchy

9. "Get Started in 3 Simple Steps" Section
   Issues: The mint green "01, 02, 03" numbers are problematic per your request
   Improvements:

Replace mint numbers with dark gray or navy
Use number circles with thin borders instead of filled mint background
Add small icons representing each step (plug, chart, star)
Include subtle connection lines between the three steps
Expand the descriptions slightly for clarity

10. Customer Stories/Testimonials
    Current: Single testimonial with carousel navigation
    Improvements:

Consider showing 2-3 testimonials visible at once on desktop
Add company logos alongside testimonial author names
Make the ROI metric ("$40K saved/month") more visually prominent
Add star ratings or trust indicators
Use subtle background cards to make testimonials stand out

11. Pricing Section
    Current: Four tiers with "MOST POPULAR" badge on Professional
    Improvements:

The Professional plan highlighting works well with the dark badge
Add visual icons to each tier name (Starter, Professional, etc.)
Consider adding a comparison table toggle below the cards
The pricing grid is dense—add more vertical spacing between features
Make the Enterprise tier visually distinct (perhaps different background)

12. Final CTA Section
    Current: "Ready to take control of your costs?" with two buttons
    Improvements:

Ensure both buttons have clear visual hierarchy
Add a brief supporting stat or social proof before the CTA
Consider a subtle background gradient or pattern here
Make the section pop with slightly more visual interest

OVERALL DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

Whitespace: Add more breathing room between sections—current layout feels slightly cramped
Hierarchy: Use more consistent sizing for section headings and descriptions
Icons: Every major section should have supporting visual elements/icons
Color Accents: Beyond mint green and the primary colors, use subtle accent colors (light grays, very light blues/purples) to organize information
Visual Flow: Add subtle animations on scroll to guide user attention downward
Consistency: All feature cards, testimonial cards, and pricing cards should have consistent styling
Readability: Increase line-height on longer text blocks for better scanability
Mobile: Ensure all sections stack elegantly on smaller screens without looking cramped
