# Antigravity Rules

## General Guidelines
- **No Over Engineering**: Avoid unnecessary complexity. Prefer simple, readable, and maintainable solutions. Do not add abstractions unless strictly necessary.
- **No Mockups**: Do not generate mockups or placeholder code. Always write fully functional, production-ready code.

## Configuration & Credentials
- **Credentials Directory**: Always look for credentials in `~/.gcp`.
    - When running scripts or configuring services, ensure they point to this directory for authentication keys.
